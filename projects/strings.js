  "<span id='impact'>(video coming soon...) A second iteration </span>to the machine room kiosk at Millburn High School's robotics lab. This new system tackles the design issues of its predecessor, designed with special care for a place that changed my life.","","<b>Stability:</b>","- Dedicated voltage regulation circuitry helps keep a stable power supply. (5.02V, 10A max)","- A fan pointed directly at the processor drastically reduces internal temperatures.","- Intake and outtake vents guide air through the display, expelling hot air from the top.","- Hardware drivers now run from startup and constantly monitor the fan and card swiper, regardless of network connection.","","<b>Build upgrades:</b>","- The casing of this kiosk is now over 40% smaller through the use of a laser cut body and tight tolerances around the bezel.","- Manufactured with a custom machined bending tool, the brushed gold aluminum trim is able to stay almost completely flush with the body of the kiosk.", "- Rigidity is a very important aspect of kiosk design. The more something flexes when you tap it, the less comfortable it is to use. Using standoffs as internal reinforcements, it's far more rigid allowing for more precise touch input."

  "<span id='impact'>8405 mk2.2</span>, the final bot a bunch of nerds and I worked on for the 2022-2023 FTC Season. Ending off my four years of high school robotics, I was the design lead for this robot. This bot was meant to be small, lightweight, and nimble, which was pulled off via the use of over 82 custom parts and months of CAD. We made it to states with only one returning member this year, and I think that's pretty remarkable. I can't wait to see what the students at the MILL pull off next. Thanks for a great four years <3."
